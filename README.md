Quartus Designs using VHDL


In order to view these projects and simulations you will need Quartus 9.0 or higher.  

If unfamiliar with with quartus, first open the project file 'fileName.qpf'. 

To see the circuit layout open 'filename.bdf' and to view a sample out put open 'filename.vwf'.

If you wish to run another .vwf simulation I suggest removing any blocks in the .bdf with the designation CLK.
Simply directly connect the clk input to the circuit and set the clock in the simulation to the speed specified on the block 

All these designs were meant to be uploaded to the Altera UP2 Flex.  

Design four is a special case and requires a few pins from the Max device in order to use the 7-seg displays.
